## `auth-lambda`

This lambda is configured (via [`cdk`](../cdk)) as the 'authoriser' for the AWS AppSync instances (see https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/appsync-lambda-auth/ for more information). In short, it verifies the auth tokens (JWT) generated by [`bootstrapping-lambda`](../bootstrapping-lambda), extracting the user's email so that it ends up in the `identity.resolverContext.userEmail` in the resolvers.
